                <p><strong>To:</strong> The Chosen One (My Boo Boo Sayang)</p>
                <p><strong>From:</strong> Agent Moo</p>
                <p><strong>Stardate:</strong> Our Second Anniversary</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Mission Debrief: The First Two Years</p>
                <br>
            
                <p>My Dearest Boo Boo Sayang,</p>
            
                <p>If you're reading this, it means you've successfully decrypted the log file. But I never had a single doubt. After all, you've always been the only one who could decode my heart.</p>
            
                <p>The last two years feel like the greatest mission I've ever been on. Our official log file began on 30 September 2023, and since then, every entry has been an adventure. From analyzing aquatic species in Palembang to debriefing with our plush canine officer, Corcor, every moment with you is a memory I've logged and cherished.</p>
            
                <p>But the most important data point, the one that holds my universe together, is you. Before you, I was just Agent Moo, flying solo. Now, I have my co-pilot, my navigator, my everything. You are my gravity. With you, even just watching the Kaciw squadron feels like discovering a new galaxy.</p>
            
                <p>I can't wait to see what missions the coming years have in store for us. More adventures, more laughter, and more just being with you. You have been chosen... by me. And I will choose you every single day, forever.</p>
            
                <p>Happy Anniversary, my love. Ooooooh!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Eternally Grateful,</p>
                <p>Your Moo</p>
